# sclo-ror42

Development of a new software collection for Ruby on Rails 4.2 to be built
in the [CentOS Software Collections SIG](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/SCLo)
as `sclo-ror42`.  Read the [introduction](https://www.redhat.com/archives/sclorg/2015-November/msg00021.html)
on the SCLorg mailing list for more info.

## Usage notes

This repo uses [tito](https://github.com/dgoodwin/tito) and
[git-annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com/).

It's pre-release, so EVRs may not match what's eventually imported into SCLo,
and it may not upgrade from one to the other.  Use at your own risk, etc.

## Contributing

Help would be appreciated.  Please get in contact via [the SCLorg mailing
list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/sclorg).
